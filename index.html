			<h4 class = "quote"> Dream Loud. Burn fast!</h4>
			<p>You’ve stumbled into the official den of Steel Reverie - the rock band that burned their way out of the ’70s and into legend.</p>
			<h4> A brief History</h4>
			<div class = "history"> 
				<p>Formation: Jack and Danny met in a grimy LA club in ‘69. Mick was passed out in the alley out back with a drumstick in his boot. Lena joined after their first bassist flaked before a show. 
					First Album: Fire Sermon (1971)
					Breakthrough Record: Ashes of Eden (1974)
					On Tour: Known for blowing the roof off every venue—and sometimes literally burning it down. Banned from three countries. 
					Band Motto: "Dream Loud. Burn Fast." </p>

					 <img class = "profile" src = "images/ProfilePhotos/Jack.png"  alt = "profile picture"><h3><b>Jack "Razor" Vance – Lead Guitar</b></h3>
					Charismatic and wild on stage, Jack’s solos melt faces and his Les Paul is practically an extension of his soul. 
				</div>
				
				<div class = "member">
					<img class = "profile" src = "images/ProfilePhotos/Danny.png"  alt = "profile picture"><h3><b>Danny Blaze – Vocals / Rhythm Guitar </b></h3>
					The frontman with a whiskey-soaked voice and a leather jacket older than most of their fans. Writes most of the lyrics—poetic, angry, and raw.
				</div>
				
				<div class = "member">
					<img class = "profile" src = "images/ProfilePhotos/Mick.png"  alt = "profile picture"><h3><b>Mick Thunder – Drums </b></h3>
					Animalistic behind the kit. Known for doing a ten-minute solo mid-set while shirtless and sweating bullets. A true heartbeat of the band. 
				</div>
				
				<div class = "member">
					<img class = "profile" src = "images/ProfilePhotos/Lena.png"  alt = "profile picture"><h3><b>Lena Steele – Bass Guitar / Backing Vocals</b></h3>
					Cool, composed, and effortlessly badass. Keeps the groove tight and adds harmonies that give their songs a haunting depth. 
				</div>
				
				<div class = "member">
					<img class = "profile" src = "images/ProfilePhotos/Ricky.png"  alt = "profile picture"><h3><b>Ricky "Keys" Malone – Keyboards / Synth </b></h3>
					Introduced later in their career when their sound evolved. Adds that prog-rock touch with vintage Moog synths and a Hammond organ.
